# FPS-Proto
Simple FPS Prototype

UNITY VERSION: UNITY 6000.2.7F2 (UNITY 6)
PACKAGES: NEW INPUT SYSTEM, NETCODE FOR ENTITIES, ENTITIES GRAPHICS, TEXTMESHPRO

Build running on Editor will act as Host-Client and other builds (apk, app, exe) act as client only.

Config inside project - find a file names GameConfig.cs inside Assets/Config and those static readonly values can be tweaked to check different scenarios.

Mobile input could not configured properly - (player controlling feel wise) due to time shortage but mac build is enjoyable.
